Login and Signup Pages:
displayLogin and displaySignup functions render the HTML pages for logging in and signing up, respectively. They include styles for a visually appealing design.
handleLogin and handleSignup functions handle the form submissions from these pages. They validate credentials and user existence, and manage redirections and error messages.

Employee Management Pages:
displayEmployees shows the list of employees in a table format and provides links to add, update, or delete employees.
displayAddEmployee, displayUpdateEmployee, and displayDeleteEmployee provide forms for adding, updating, and deleting employees, respectively.
addEmployee, updateEmployee, and functions to handle the deletion process (not fully included) are responsible for modifying the employee data.

Data Handling:
Functions loadUsers, saveUsers, loadEmployees, and saveEmployees handle reading from and writing to the respective text files.

Error Handling:
Ensure that all potential errors (like file read/write errors) are handled gracefully. You might want to add try-catch blocks around file operations.

Security:
Passwords should be hashed before saving them to the file. Plain text passwords are a significant security risk.

Input Validation:
Consider adding more rigorous validation for inputs, particularly when updating or deleting employee records, to ensure data integrity.

Session Management:
Ensure that session management is robust and consider using a session store or cookie-based authentication for more secure handling of user sessions.

Code Organization:
For better maintainability, you might want to modularize your code, separating concerns into different files (e.g., routes, controllers, utility functions).
